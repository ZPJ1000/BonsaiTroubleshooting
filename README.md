sequence detection task mouse: basic stimuli presentation
Phase 1:
need to have a sequence of visual stimuli  (gratings) drawn (time fixed, with only background in between) based on a 4-element unidirectional loop
the first stimuli should be randomized. The following stimuli should follow in sequential order (ie a-b-c, b-c-d, c-d-a, d-a-b). Randomize a sequence, with each number identifying a specific angle for the grate. 
(once it works, also have link the identifier to the temporal frequency (1-4)

Phase 2: integrate incorrect trials
option to randomize (at a specified probability) the 1st, 2nd and/or 3rd stimuli with an unfamiliar/very different stimuli (blue square or whatever)
start with all stimuli wrong, then 2, then 1

Phase 3: integrate incorrect trials with familiar stimuli
option to randomize (at a specified probability) the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd stimuli with the last unused stimuli in the loop (ie if correct is b-c-d, swap one of them for a)

Phase 4: integrate incorrect trials with only one characteristic (grate or temporal frequency) incorrect
option (on 10-30% of trials) to swap the wrong direction or temporal frequency only of the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd stimuli 
  first with unfamiliar stimuli characteristic, ie b-c-d turns into b-c-d(random angle OR speed)
  next, within the familiar stimuli ie b-c-d turns into b-c-d (with angle or speed from stimuli a)
